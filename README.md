## General info
This project is a simple c++ app, with SDL2 library
    
## Technologies
I'm writing this project on macOS using Xcode, so there are some settings in the library and the file arrangement is a bit different than usual, but that doesn't stop you from learning too :writing_hand:

Project is created with:
* C++: ^20
